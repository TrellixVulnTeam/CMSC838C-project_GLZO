<!-- ## Final Project

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/farnazzam/XR-project-website/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files. -->

### Project Description
- An AR application that displays useful information about a building, as well as its rooms when a mobile device is pointed at a specific room
- We will achieve this by detecting the room number and extracting the relevant details about the space from university websites
- We plan to use a combination of image recognition and geotagging to ascertain the location of the user and collect data to display

### Proposed Tasks
- Collect and process relevant data from various sources such as  UMD CS Google Calendar, CS Talks website,  and any  databases that we can request access too.
- Find the user’s location (which building)  using GPS and the relative position  of the user with reference to a defined origin in the building
- Given a room number, get information about what is happening inside at any time
- Overlay this text onto the room using AR

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/farnazzam/XR-project-website/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
