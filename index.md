### Project Description
- An AR application that displays useful information about a building, as well as its rooms when a mobile device is pointed at a specific room
- We will achieve this by detecting the room number and extracting the relevant details about the space from university websites
- We plan to use a combination of image recognition and geotagging to ascertain the location of the user and collect data to display

### Proposed Tasks
- Collect and process relevant data from various sources such as  UMD CS Google Calendar, CS Talks website,  and any  databases that we can request access too.
- Find the userâ€™s location (which building)  using GPS and the relative position  of the user with reference to a defined origin in the building
- Given a room number, get information about what is happening inside at any time
- Overlay this text onto the room using AR
